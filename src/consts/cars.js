      'Powered by a 5.2 L V10 engine shared with the Gallardo, the engine generated a theoretical maximum power output of 600 PS (592 hp; 441 kW) and was accompanied with an all-wheel-drive system.

The production version of the SUV was introduced in 2017 with major changes done to the exterior and featuring a different powertrain than that of the concept.',
